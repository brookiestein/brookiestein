- 👋 Hi, I’m @brookiestein
- 👀 I’m really interested in software development, and computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and the Qt Framework, and a little bit of Android development with Kotlin.
- 💞️ I have more knowledge and experience in C and C++, but I'll learn other languages as well.
